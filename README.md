##  Website for easy reading of BhagavadGeeta and Other philosophy books 

Most of us rely on scanned pages or Old style hard copy books. They have obvious disadvantages to having native online version (not scanned).

- Hardcopy 
    - Paper can deteriorate over time
    - Error cannot be corrected
    - Cannot cross reference

- Scanned copy
    - Often from older books: Readability is compromised
    - Searching is impossible.
    - Unless whole book is scanned, disorganized
    - All the negatives of Hardcopy book continue to exist
