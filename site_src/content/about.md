#### Aim:
This is an experiment to covert some important philosophical books to   native computer format (encoded in UTF-8). Having the books in native format helps in :-
 - Rendering them neatly on various devices (such as phone and tablets)
 - Unlocks search functionality which helps in cross-referencing/searching.
 - Having in a shared Git repository help in collaboration and fixing error quickly.
